                <h3>University Success Rate Dashboard</h3>
                <p>The success and expansion of universities are largely determined by two essential factors: staffing levels and financial resources. The size of the staff, encompassing both faculty and administrative employees, plays a direct role in the quality of education, research productivity, and student support, which collectively influence overall university performance. Sufficient funding, sourced from government grants, tuition fees, and private contributions, is vital for sustaining and improving infrastructure, research capabilities, and academic offerings. These elements together shape a university's ability to deliver high-quality education, engage in innovative research, and attract top talent, ultimately fueling institutional growth and success.</p>
